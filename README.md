# Scheme-o-matic
This tool is a web-based, locally-hosted editor and debugger for a
variant of the Scheme programming language. It is forked from [61A
Scheme](https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/scheme_editor).

To run the editor, run the command `python3 editor` in your terminal.
If it does not automatically open the webpage in your browser,
navigate to the URL you see in the terminal (e.g.
http://127.0.0.1:31415/).

Use `python3 editor -f [filenames]...` to specify the files to
initially open.

This tool has no dependencies, and requires web access only to load
the Glyphicons (all other libraries are self contained).
